# PlateShapez
A quick and simple way to automate small, hardly-noticeable, random gaussian shapes to confuse AI license plate readers used by law enforcement and retailers. 

This runs in Processing and can be instantly run with no installation (aside from Processing itself). https://processing.org/ 

I put the readme in the code as you'll be customizing it a bit to fit your own tests and license plate.
